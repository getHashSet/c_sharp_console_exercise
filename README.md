## About 
 
Created a simple console application that will prompt for user input and return one number divided by another.

## Try Catch Finaly
 
Because this application uses user input there will need to be error handling. Using the Try/Catch/Finally functions and the Exception argument I was able to make sure the user cannot crash the application when entering a value that is not a number. 
 
## Code Example
 
```c# 
try {} catch(DivideByZeroException e) {} finally { /*This code will run every time*/ };
 ```
